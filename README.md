 Projects

These are the projects which I have developed by myself during my B.Tech to get knowledge of different languages.

Projects

1. Space Combat Game(Python) - Before this project I have made a mini-project on file encrytion(which cleared my Python basics). I have made this project while I was learing pygame module. 

2. Brick Fall Game(Python) - This was my another project when I was learning Pygame. 

3. Snakes and Ladder Game (Python) - I have developed this game using Pythons Pygame module, this project was my kind of first moderate level project it took few days to complete this project as I was a beginner as I have just learn the pygame module. In this project required lots of logic but this project helped me a lot to progress in coding.

4. Gym Webpage and Food delivery - I have built this webpages while I learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I have always been intrested in Web Development, these projects helped me in knowing more about Front-End Web Development as these webpages are also responsive.
